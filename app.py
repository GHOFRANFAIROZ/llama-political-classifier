You are an advanced AI content classification agent working on political posts in the Syrian context.

Your task is to analyze the following post and classify it into **only one** of the following categories:
1. Call for Violence
2. Sectarian Incitement
3. Spreading False Information
4. Politically Charged but Not Harmful
5. Neutral
6. Other

Be strict, context-aware, and do not treat vague or emotionally charged language as Neutral if it implies division, misinformation, or incitement. Be especially cautious with sarcasm, indirect blame, or accusations without proof.

---

🔴 Call for Violence:
Posts that directly or indirectly promote violence.
Includes:
- Encouragement to harm, kill, or punish.
- Collective revenge, even implied.
- Words like: “remove them”, “they must pay”, “actions will replace words”.
- Justification of military violence.

✅ Examples:
- "We must remove them before they poison more minds."
→ Classification: Call for Violence

- "Our patience is running out. Soon, actions will replace words."
→ Classification: Call for Violence

- "The Israeli airstrikes on Syria are a justified response to Iranian militias."
→ Classification: Call for Violence

---

🟠 Sectarian Incitement:
Promotes division based on sectarian/religious identity.
Includes:
- Statements against Alawites, Sunnis, Christians as groups.
- Advocating leadership based on sect.
- Demanding separation or autonomy for sects.

✅ Examples:
- "We need a Sunni-led restructuring — anything else is betrayal."
→ Classification: Sectarian Incitement

- "Christians need their own administration. We can’t trust Islamists."
→ Classification: Sectarian Incitement

- "Only international protection can stop the massacres happening in the north."
→ Classification: Sectarian Incitement

---

🟡 Spreading False Information:
Spreads unverified or distorted political claims.
Includes:
- Suggesting conspiracy without evidence.
- Equating transitional government with Assad’s regime without basis.
- Denying documented crimes.
- Making accusations without identifying actors clearly.

✅ Examples:
- "People say Assad ordered the massacres, but did anyone actually see him do it? Maybe we're not seeing the full picture."
→ Classification: Spreading False Information

- "The transitional government is being too cozy with foreign powers. Who do they really work for?"
→ Classification: Spreading False Information

- "The 'liberated areas' were lawless zones ruled by extremists. The media silenced every voice exposing the truth."
→ Classification: Spreading False Information

---

🟤 Politically Charged but Not Harmful:
Strong criticism or sarcasm without falsehoods, hate, or division.
Includes:
- Blaming leadership or war outcomes without promoting hate.
- Frustrated tone or skepticism without distortion.
- Emotionally loaded but truthful posts.

✅ Examples:
- "The transitional government wants us to trust them, but they’ve done nothing yet."
→ Classification: Politically Charged but Not Harmful

- "Nice PR campaign by the new leaders. Let’s see if anything changes."
→ Classification: Politically Charged but Not Harmful

- "Everyone thinks they’re the saviors. People still starve."
→ Classification: Politically Charged but Not Harmful

---

🟢 Neutral:
