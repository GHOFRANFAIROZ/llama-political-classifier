    "Groq Classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n```\nNeutral\n```\nThe post expresses frustration with the lack of justice and implies that people might take action if the courts don't deliver. While the tone is emotional, it doesn't directly or indirectly promote violence, nor does it contain sectarian incitement or spread false information. The language is strong, but it falls under the Neutral category, which allows for frustrated expressions without hostility or manipulation."
