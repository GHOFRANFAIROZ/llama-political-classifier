    "Groq Classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n**Sectarian Incitement**\n\nThe phrase \"they start screaming\" creates a sense of opposition to a specific group, implying that this group is the one who always feels threatened when the idea of unity is mentioned. The use of \"they\" creates a sense of othering, which is a characteristic of sectarian incitement. Additionally, the mention of \"minority rights\" and \"federalism\" as something that is being opposed suggests that the post is promoting division based on sectarian identity."
