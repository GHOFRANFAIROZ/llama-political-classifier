    "Groq Classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n**Sectarian Incitement**\n\nThe post promotes division based on sectarian identity, advocating for a system that \"protects minorities\" (implying that Sunnis are a threat to minorities) and ensuring that \"majoritarian rule\" (i.e., Sunni majority) is not allowed to return. This language incites sectarian division and promotes a narrative of Sunni oppression, which is a classic characteristic of sectarian incitement."
