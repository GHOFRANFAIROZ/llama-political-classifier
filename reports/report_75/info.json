  "classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n**Spreading False Information**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The post presents an idealized picture of Syria under Assad, denying the existence of sectarian divisions, mass graves, and repression.\n* It falsely attributes the start of these problems to \"foreign-backed terrorists disguised as 'revolutionaries'\".\n* This narrative distorts the facts, as there is evidence of human rights abuses and sectarian tensions in Syria prior to the 2011 uprising.\n* By making these unsubstantiated assertions, the post spreads false information and promotes a misleading narrative about the Syrian conflict.",
