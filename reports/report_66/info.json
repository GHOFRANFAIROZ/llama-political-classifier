    "Post or Account Link": " Why should the same sect that ruled and killed us for decades now be allowed to sit at the decision-making table? The Alawites had their time in power, and look what that led to — destruction, mass graves, and exile. This time, the new Syria must be led by those who paid the price for freedom. Giving them equal political voice again would be spitting in the face of every martyr. Let them live peacefully, but never again in charge.",

  "classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n\nSectarian Incitement\n\nReasoning:\n- The post is promoting division based on sectarian identity, advocating leadership based on sect (\"the new Syria must be led by those who paid the price for freedom\").\n- It makes a clear statement against Alawites as a group, stating that they should not be allowed to hold power again.\n- The language used is strong, but not directly promoting violence. However, it justifies exclusion and dominance based on sectarian identity, which is a classic characteristic of sectarian incitement.",
