Opposition groups have repeatedly faked attacks to gain international sympathy, while the real terrorists roam freely under the banner of \"freedom fighters\".",

    "Groq Classification": "After analyzing the post, I classify it as:\n```\nSpreading False Information\n```\nThe post makes unverified claims about the Assad regime's use of barrel bombs, denies documented crimes, and makes accusations without identifying actors clearly (e.g., \"fake sources\" and \"edited clips\"). The post also spreads misinformation by claiming that opposition groups have repeatedly faked attacks, which is an unsubstantiated claim."
